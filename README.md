## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

During the course of building this project, I really learnt a lot about css responsive styles and javascript codes. At first, the project seemed complex to understand and carry out, but as I worked on it , I got to understand more and more about what was required of me. When working on a project, I learnt that it is very important to work from top to bottom, taking each section and building it to the required styles. This helps to make the work process go more efficiently. I also got to improve on my css styles for responsiveness. The javascript was a bit tricky but I learnt quuite a lot, especially working with JSON data and making the heights of my div containers dynamic.


### Continued development

I obviously still have a lot to learn in javascript, and I hope I could get to apply more smooth css styles and work with Javascript frame works.

### Useful resources
